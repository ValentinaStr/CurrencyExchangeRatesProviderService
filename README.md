CurrencyExchangeRatesProviderService
🚀 About the Project
CurrencyExchangeRatesProviderService is a Spring Boot application designed to provide up-to-date exchange rates for supported currencies. By default, the currency list is empty, but it can be extended via API endpoints. The service integrates with fixer.io to fetch and update exchange rates every hour.

Key features include retrieving exchange rates for supported currencies, adding new currencies to the system, and storing historical exchange rate data in a PostgreSQL database. The service also uses in-memory caching for fast access to frequently requested data.

Key Features
Up-to-date exchange rates: Fetching exchange rates from fixer.io.
Periodic updates: Exchange rates are automatically updated every hour.
Database storage: Exchange rates are stored in a PostgreSQL database for long-term storage.
Extendable currency list: The ability to add new currencies to the system.
Testing: Includes comprehensive unit and integration tests for reliable service operation.
🎓 Requirements
For local development, make sure you have the following tools installed:

Java 21 or higher
Gradle for building the project
Docker (for running PostgreSQL and other necessary services)
⚙️ Quick Start
1. Clone the repository
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/ValentinaStr/CurrencyExchangeRatesProviderService.git
cd CurrencyExchangeRatesProviderService
2. Set up PostgreSQL with Docker
Run PostgreSQL and manage the database schema using Docker:

bash
Copy code
docker-compose up
This will start PostgreSQL in a container, which will be used for storing exchange rates.

3. Build and run the service
To build and run the service, use the following commands:

bash
Copy code
./gradlew build
./gradlew bootRun
The service will start fetching exchange rates from fixer.io and will update them every hour.

🛠️ How It Works
The service integrates with fixer.io to fetch up-to-date exchange rates. These rates are cached in memory for fast access and saved in PostgreSQL for long-term storage.

Exchange rates are automatically updated every hour using scheduled tasks in Spring. The service provides flexibility, allowing users to easily add new currencies to the list.

Database and schema management:
Exchange rates are stored in a PostgreSQL database using Spring Data JPA. The database schema is managed with Liquibase, ensuring consistency and ease of updates.

🛠️ Tools and Technologies
